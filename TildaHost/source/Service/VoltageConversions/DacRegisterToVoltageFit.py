Config File for the storage of the slope and the offset
 fitted from measurement of the DAC-Register of the AD5781 vs. Voltage read back with Agilent 3401A.

    -----------------> DAC Reg (D)

        V = slope * D + offset

 The slope should be close to 76.29 ÂµV (which is the least significant bit in an 18Bit +/-10V DAC)
 Offset should be the negative reference voltage (close to -10 V)
